					<p> How it works?</p>
                    <p class="Text"> You’re it - a location based mobile tag game where you are challenged to find players based off their cell phone GPS. But don’t worry,  its not your average game of tag - its better than that! <br /><br />

A point based system allows you to upgrade skills and your player’s appearance. The player receives points in a multitude of ways.  Points can be earned by tagging an opponent that has been on map. Based on the proximity to the opponent a multiplier will be added, the closer one is to the opponent, the more points they will receive.  
<br /><br />
Points can be used to buy power ups and change appearance of your players icon. Power-up can range from an invisibility cloak to increase tagging distance to a hologram that can trick others of your location.  <br /><br />
 
Sponsorship will play a key role in You’re it. Incentives will be located randomly place and strategically place through the map - or what we call hot-spots. Per say, its the Greek Festival this week and the Tourism Ottawa has sponsored a location for Greek Festival on the You’re it map. Extra points or rare objects can be available at the Greek Festival promoting activity and exploration of your city as well as bringing people close together. The incentives range from power ups to bonus points. </p>

					<p>Future Release Plan</p>
                    <p class="Text">Social Media <br /><br />

Twitter and Facebook will be a great way to drive traffic to the website and share updates with
players and potential users. We have set up the accounts prior to launch in order to allow potential users to see how the app is being made and to feel like they are part of the journey that continues through the release of the app.<br /><br />

<a style="color:blue;" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Youre-It/631577553550925">Facebook </a><br />
<a style="color:blue;" href="https://twitter.com/youreitapp">Twitter </a>
<br /><br />
Bus Ads<br /><br />

We are focusing on using local transit advertisements as the primary physical marketing strategy for the app. OC Transpo allows for bus advertisements in the interior of the bus. A large  portion of our target customers are students and young adults, many of whom rely on the local transit system as their primary source of transportation.  We believe having advertisements on the bus, coupled with our social media efforts will be the most effective way to reach our target audience. </p>
